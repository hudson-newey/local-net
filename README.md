# Local Net

Because the internet is distributed across nodes, it is reasonable that its possible to cache outgoing requests and responses. Extending the life time of this cache allows us to get faster responses, a better understanding of the code we run (we can analyze it in post with independent scripts), and a higher degree of privacy.

This is a bit of fun, so I don't recommend using this in any serious context
